    <string name="steak_review">Blue Sofa Pasta, a steak restaurant in Yeonnam-dong that is good for a date in Yeonnam-dong. Let me introduce you to a steak restaurant in Yeonnam-dong that has a nice atmosphere and tastes good :) The alley is not crowded and it is not located in the downtown area, so it was not difficult to find! If you bring your car, there is nothing to worry about. There is a public parking lot nearby in Yeonnam-dong, so it wouldn\'t be a bad idea to park there and use it.</string>
